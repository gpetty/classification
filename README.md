# Pairwise Similarity Partitioning algorithm

Python code implementing and demonstrating the Pairwise Similarity Partitioning algorithm described by Petty (2022): The Pairwise Similarity Partitioning algorithm: a method for unsupervised partitioning of geoscientific and other datasets using arbitrary similarity metrics.  *Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems* ([link](https://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-22-0005.1)).

Files in this archive include the following:

* **PSP_Preprint2.pdf** — a preprint of the paper describing the algorithm as accepted by *Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems* (not yet copy-edited for publication), now published in final form [here](https://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-22-0005.1).
* **PSP_minimal.py** — a minimal implementation of the PSP algorithm consisting solely of a function definition.
* **PSP.py** - a complete module implementating a PSP class with associated methods; required by many of the Jupyter notebooks listed below.
* **PSP_DemoData1**  — a binary file containing the mock dataset used to create Figs. 2-7 of the above paper. Might not be portable.
* **Make_DemoData1.ipynb** — Jupyter notebook that recreates the above datafile
* **Fig2-4.ipynb** — Jupyter notebook that recreates Figs. 2–4 in the paper.
* **Fig6.ipynb** — Jupyter notebook that recreates Fig. 6
* **Fig7.ipynb** — Jupyter notebook that recreates Fig. 7
